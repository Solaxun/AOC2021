Another year, another Advent of Code!  I had grand ambitions of doing every problem in each of Clojure, Go, and Python but I don't think I'm going to find the time to pull that off.  I will do my best to finish each problem with Python and Clojure, which I'm generally more comfortable with, and I'll probably cherrypick a few that I think would be fun in Go which I am a complete novice with.

In past years I made it a rule to never look at other's solutions until I figured it out, but this time I'm going to be a bit easier on myself and spend several hours before looking for hints.

So far I've had to get hints on:
- Day 6
- Day 14
- Day 18

I'm clearly really bad at the "now do it 1e9 times" problems.
